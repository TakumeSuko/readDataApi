This project demonstrates how to fetch data from an API using gRPC instead of traditional REST.

The application connects to a gRPC service, sends requests, and displays the returned data in the frontend. It is built to showcase how gRPC can be integrated into a modern web application.

You can view the API response logs and data output inside: /src/app/page.js

This file contains the main implementation for calling the gRPC service and handling the response data.
